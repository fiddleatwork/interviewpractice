My solutions to coding problems to practice for interviews
Using Cracking the Coding Interview, Leetcode, HackerRank, and other sources.

These are done in Kotlin in a "functional" style:
  - immutable whenever possible
  - pure functions
  - streams

Some problems don't lend themselves to this approach and must modify variables, use iterative loops, etc.
