My solutions to coding problems to practice for interviews
Using Cracking the Coding Interview, Leetcode, HackerRank, and other sources.

The main language I'm using is Kotlin, in a "functional" style:
  - immutable whenever possible
  - pure functions
  - streams & function chaining

Some problems don't lend themselves to this approach and must modify variables, use iterative loops, etc.
Or would use something more advanced but less easy to understand so I opted for the simple approach.

I'm also adding some solutions in Python as well.  My goal is to program in Python in a functional style,
similar to Kotlin.  However Python isn't as "fluid" as Kotlin so far which makes this difficult.

There are also a few solutions in Java which I did while preparing for Java interviews.  I find
it difficult to go back to Java after Kotlin.
